A few words about me

#intro
Based on Kathmandu, Nepal, I’m a software developer

With a background in IT and since 2020 delivering impactful digital solutions. My work bridges innovation and usability to craft thoughtful, user-focused applications across diverse domains, including finance, e-commerce, and healthcare.

Whether collaborating with cross-functional teams or taking the lead on complex projects, I bring a blend of technical precision and creative problem-solving that ensures exceptional results.

Beyond client projects, I'm continuously advancing my skills—experimenting with new technologies, reading, and developing personal projects to stay at the forefront of the field.
